# Upgrade Guide

## Upgrading from v5 to v6

- Installation
  - Styled-UI v6 should be installed as a **direct** dependency, not a peerDependency anymore.
- Importing
  - Importing from `'@faithlife/styled-ui/v6'` has been removed—import v6 components from `'@faithlife/styled-ui'` now.
- `Accordion`
  - The `styleOverrides` prop has been removed in favor of Styled System props. Use style props for `Accordion.Panel` directly on that component.
- `Button`
  - Check your variants:
    - `primaryOutline` has been replaced by `secondary`.
    - `primaryTransparent` has been replaced by `link` and now uses inline spacing (no padding) by default.
  - Check your sizes:
    - Standalone props have been replaced by the `size` prop, such as `size="medium"` instead of `medium`.
    - Size definitions have also changed, and the `condensed` prop is no longer used. The following table summarizes the differences:
      ```
                 ┌───────────────────────────┬────────────────────────────┬────────────────────────────┐
                 │          "small"          │          "medium"          │          "large"           │

      ```
    - Size variant styles no longer change the dimensions of child `<svg>`s, so manually resize yours as needed.
- `Checkbox`
  - The old `theme` prop functionality has been replaced by the [global theme object](https://faithlife.github.io/styled-ui/#/theme/usage) and Styled System props. Use the [`ThemeProvider` component](https://faithlife.github.io/styled-ui/#/theme/customization) to customize the theme.
- `DatePickerInput`
  - The `styleOverrides` prop has been removed in favor of Styled System props. Use style props for the input directly on the `DatePickerInput` component, and use style props for the calendar popover on a `DatePickerInput.Popover` child config component.
  - The `placement` prop has been removed—use `placement` on `DatePickerInput.Popover` instead.
- `Dropdown`
  - The `Dropdown` component has been renamed to `Menu`.
  - "Dropdown" is a general term that refers to content inside of a popover. For more details, see the docs on the `Menu` and `Listbox` components.

- `LoadingSpinner`
  - The old `theme` prop functionality has been replaced by the [global theme object](https://faithlife.github.io/styled-ui/#/theme/usage) and Styled System props. Use the [`ThemeProvider` component](https://faithlife.github.io/styled-ui/#/theme/customization) to customize the theme.

- `text-input` components
  - Components previously imported from `'@faithlife/styled-ui/dist/text-input-v2'` should now be imported from `'@faithlife/styled-ui/text-input'`:
    ```code
    lang: js
    ---
    import {
    	AsyncSelect,
    	CreatableSelect,
    	AsyncCreatableSelect,
    	Select,
    	avatarComponents,
    	reactSelectComponents,
    	InferredText,
    	InferredSelect,
    } from '@faithlife/styled-ui/text-input';
    ```
  - Deprecated components previously imported from `'@faithlife/styled-ui/dist/text-input'` (`Typeahead`, `AsyncTypeahead`, `Token`, `Menu`, `MenuItem`, `InferredTypeahead`) have been removed.
  - `Select` components behave slightly differently now in one situation. When `isMulti` is `true`, if one or more options are selected and then later all selected options are removed, upon the removal of the last option the value passed to `onChange` will be `null`. In v5, the value passed to `onChange` in this situation would have been `[]`. See the [React Select v3 upgrade guide](https://github.com/JedWatson/react-select/issues/3585) for more details.
- `Tooltip`
  - The `styleOverrides` prop has been removed in favor of Styled System props.
