### Why?

This project addresses problems introduced by creating components from scratch. Often a component from spec gets implemented multiple times, either from Zeplin or forked from an existing control. Each time an implementation happens, inconsistencies are introduced. It's also harder to introduce animations and shadows after the prototype has been built. By using reference components instead, there's a much higher chance the final products will the contain all margins, animations, and hover states the design calls for.

### Goals

- Components in this library must be built with [Styled Components](https://www.styled-components.com/) + [React](https://reactjs.org/). Large additional runtime libraries should not be added such as `moment`, but tiny dependencies like `lodash.debounce` are OK.
- UI components should support basic color theming and should have a variation documented that demos an alternate theme.
- UI components are simple. For complex components (such as a sortable list control with inline search), consider creating a reusable component in a separate project
- Style modifications should be approved by the design team before they are merged into this project
- Components should have a prose description and live demo of different component states (using real data)
- UI components are accompanied by documentation to show how the component should be used within a real app. The UI components should rely on a parent component to contain state, however in some cases local state may be used to handle UI-specific concerns (such the location of a popup or visibility)
- Semantic versioning / version history updates when making releases

### Non-goals

- Use across teams other than Engagement Products (future goal?)
