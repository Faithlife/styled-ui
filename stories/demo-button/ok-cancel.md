# Okay Cancel Buttons

It's common to need both a commit action ("OK", "Done", "Save") right next to a cancel action. Faithlife house style is:

* "Cancel" on the left, "OK" on the right.
* Cancel/Okay buttons go at the bottom of the dialog (or section) they govern.
* This is because you read forms from top-left (start) to bottom-right (end), and we want the default action ("OK") at the logical end. Otherwise, people accidentally hit "Cancel".
* If the actions govern a whole page, then they go at the top-right of the page, in line with the page headline. Again, "OK" at the far right.
* Cancel/Okay buttons may be repeated at the bottom of a long page.
* We know that other companies do this differently, and that's okay.
