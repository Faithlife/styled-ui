### Icons in Buttons

By default, buttons have text but no icons. They can also have:

* `withIcon` -- button has text and icon.
* `iconOnly` -- button has an icon and no text.

Add an icon to a button to:

* reinforce its visual weight (icons attract user attention);
* enhance the button text with a conventional meaning belonging to the icon (example: add a gear to imply "advanced").

Notes:

* Icons are located within an 18 x 18 px bounding box. The icon artwork should include this bounding box and the path should be centered visually within the box to align well with text (if any). (This work is generally done in UI/UX.)
* Space between an icon and text on a button is prescribed by the button scale factor.
* Icon-only buttons have equal padding all around, and determined by the button's scale factor.
