For the next major version of Styled UI, the Radio component has been rebuilt to use our global Styled System theme and two new config components instead of its legacy `theme` prop.

You can opt in to the new API now by importing `{ Radio } from '@faithlife/styled-ui/v6'`.

This documentation is automatically generated from jsdoc comments.

```react
noSource: true
---
<DocgenTable component={Radio} />
```
