For the next major version of Styled UI, the SimpleToast component has been rebuilt to use Styled System primitives.

You can opt in to the new API now by importing `{ SimpleToast } from '@faithlife/styled-ui/v6'`.

This documentation is automatically generated from JSDoc comments.

```react
noSource: true

<DocgenTable component={SimpleToast} />
