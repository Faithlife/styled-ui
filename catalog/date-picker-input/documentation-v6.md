For the next major version of Styled UI, the DatePickerInput component has been rebuilt to use Styled System primitives.

You can opt in to the new API now by importing `{ DatePickerInput } from '@faithlife/styled-up/v6'`.

This documentation is automatically generated from JSDoc comments.

```react
noSource: true
---
<DocgenTable component={DatePickerInput} />
```
