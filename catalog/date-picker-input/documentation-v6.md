For the next major version of Styled UI, the DatePickerInput component has been rebuilt to use Styled System primitives.

You can opt in to the new API now by importing `{ DatePickerInput } from '@faithlife/styled-up/v6'`. When v6 is released, the `/v6` entrypoint will continue to be supported with a deprecation warning until v7 is released.
