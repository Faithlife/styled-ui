For the next major version of Styled UI, the Checkbox component has been rebuilt to use our global Styled System theme instead of its legacy `theme` prop.

You can opt in to the new API now by importing `{ Checkbox } from '@faithlife/styled-ui/v6'`. When v6 is released, the `/v6` entrypoint will continue to be supported with a deprecation warning until v7 is released.
