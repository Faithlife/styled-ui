For the next major version of Styled UI, the LoadingSpinner component has been rebuilt to use Styled System primitives and its theme API.

You can opt in to the new API now by importing `{ LoadingSpinner } from '@faithlife/styled-ui/v6'`.

This documentation is automatically generated from jsdoc comments.

```react
noSource: true
---
<DocgenTable component={LoadingSpinner} />
```
